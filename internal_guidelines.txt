ORGANIZATION

Code Execution Steps
  1. Process raw measurement data.
  2. Analyze processed measurement data.

Files Structure
	\scripts\ - for scripts
		processing - previously Keithley
		analysis - previously dataProcessingScript
	\resources\ - for resources, such as input and output data
		analysis_reports\ - output reports generated when code is run, populated automatically
		processed_data\ - csv files containing processed version of raw measurement data, populated automatically
	\old_guidelines\ - for previous team's guidelines, temporary aka will delete when not needed anymore
	\.gitignore - to configure what files git ignores, update to include unnecessary data, as necessary
	\LICENSE - outdated license outlining repo fair use 
	\README.md - first repo file immediately visible to public, aka external stakeholders
	\INSTRUCTIONS.txt - contains repo use instructions
	\internal_guidelines.txt - contains developer guidelines

Datatype Structure

[old]
dataBaseCollator (utils/base.py)
--csvItem (utils/csvItem.py)
----cvsParser (utils/csvParser.py)
--pdfGen (pdfGenerator/pdfgen.py)
--CellAnalyzerReport (resistanceAnalyzer/report.py)
----CellAnalyzer (cellanalyzer.py)
----ProcessState (report.py)

dataBaseCollator calls cellSizeDataBase, even tho that is not a datatype.

[new]
CsvFile and ProcessState only classes


GUIDELINES

Overview
  Analyzing measurement data is performed as two-step process. 

  1. Process raw measurement data.
	   - [NEW] Format raw files as necessary, then convert to a custom datatype(s).
	   - [OG] Convert raw files to a custom datatype.
  2. Analyze processed measurement data.   
	   - "Input" must be custom datatype(s).
	   - Create data analysis reports.

Limitations (Might delete)
  List any internal restrictions or requirements (regarding the entire repo) here, such as python version compatibilty.

Known Issues
  - in cvsParser.py, on Windows,
		"file = open(csvPath, 'r')" -> "file = open(csvPath, 'r', encoding = 'utf8')"

Resources
  - consider not storing resource data on the cloud, as it is unnecessary and clogs up git commits. 
  - cloud (repo) storage is limited.


Script Interaction
  script files call other script files
  
Script 1 (header for each script file to be explained here)

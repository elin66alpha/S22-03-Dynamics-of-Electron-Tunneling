# Micron Dynamics of Electron Tunneling - Central Repository

*In development

## Project Summary:
x

### Previous Work:
Among other things, the previous team discovered a crucial case of unexpected behavior. A spontaneous set of a neighboring cell.
	
### Goal:
To capture (measure) aforementioned unexpected behavior, then explore limits of neighboring cell.

### Procedure:
1. Measure a test case
2. Analyze test case
3. Plan next test case, to get closer to goal
4. Repeat

## Overview:
This repo serves to make measurement analysis (step 2) and its interactions efficient. Thus, increasing the efficiency of both measurement (step 1) and planning (step 3).

## Instructions:
For detailed instructions on how to use this repo to analyze measurement data, see INSRUCTIONS.txt.
	
## Developer Notes:
For detailed guidelines, see README.txt.

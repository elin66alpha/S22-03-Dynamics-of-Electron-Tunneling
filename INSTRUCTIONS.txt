INSTRUCTIONS

Overview 
	Raw lab data, stored in excel binary format, are processed into CSV format. Then, these CSVs are analyzed to plot the data, and PDF reports are generated.
  
Limitations
	<List any external restrictions or requirements here, such as lab equipment or procedure used, or input formatting.>
	
	1. CSVs are not cleared from their \resources\processed_data\ directory. (Analysis generates PDF reports for all CSVs currently in the directory.) You need to manually wipe this as needed.

	2. In fact, Git is configured to ignore \resources\. This means Git will not keep backups of your data, nor overwrite or clear it for you. 
	
	3. Regarding lab, a log must be kept when doing the measurements. This maps information not stored in the raw data to information in the raw data, such as cell location(s) and probe setup to run number.	
		a. Currently, any line in the log file that is invalid, such as having a blank run number, will output an error message then continue processing subsequent data.
		b. Be sure to follow the appropriate guidelines for populating the log. 
			1) A known issue regards the new 3-probe, or 3-terminal probe setup, set/reset/form operations. Since this may not behave as expected, populate the log file as you
			would for a 2-terminal set/reset/form operation. For example, if you are setting the "probed" cell, which normally goes in the second cell location column for 3-probe measurements, put it in the first cell location column. 
	  
Run Code
  
  1. [one-time] Make sure you have Python v3.7 or greater installed, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  
  2. Copy raw data, following instructions in /resources/raw_data/README.md
  
  3. [optional] Clear (delete) any older CSVs in /resources/processed_data/.
  
  4. `cd '.../S22-03-Dynamics-of-Electron-Tunneling'` As, the following commands need to be ran from your repo dir.
  
  5. Windows Powershell: `python $pwd/scripts/processing/keithley_import.py <your_log_file_name_without_extension> <date>`
	 Linux: `python3 ~/.../scripts/processing/keithley_import.py <your_log_file_name_without_extension> <date>`
	
	a. For <date>, can either write ONE date or `all`. Using one date will only run data in log file from that date.
	   It also needs to match the string in the log file. 
	   i.e. 02/11/2023 vs. 2/11/2023 matters.
	   
	b. Scan console output for any errors. An error either means the log file is not correct or you found a bug.   

  6. Windows Powershell: `python $pwd/scripts/analysis/`
	 Linux: `python3 ~/.../scripts/analysis/` 
	
  7. Done! Report is generated in /resources/analysis_reports/
